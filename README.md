Remocon Mobile Control was requested by multiple people from within The Official Remocon Discord Server. <br> Im A single developer and I've made this app with the assistance of @tobmood

## Current Features

* List all available Robots that are at Remocon.tv
* List all live Robots that are viewable at Remocon.tv

## App Details
For now, Viewing a Robot will open your default web browser to view a Robot. This will be fixed in a later release. <br>
